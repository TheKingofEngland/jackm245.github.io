    <td>To start of this lesson we had to go into our stock sheet and add a code to every item and work out how much it had cost to make a certain item. We made a new column called "code" and one called “Cost Price.” We deleted the contents out of our sale price column and entered a new number into our cost price column. We then made entered a number into a different cell on the spreadsheet. This number is from 0%-100% and will be how much profit you want to make.Then enter this into each of your sale price cells: “=(<where your cell is for the cost price>*$<Cell letter of the profit box>$<cell number of the profit box>+<where your cell is for the cost price>)”. We then created an indv price using VLOOKUP and a code box on the order form where you can choose what you want to order. Todays lesson was very confusing and did take a lot of trial and error. I had to have lots of perseverance and be able to think logically to help solve problems with my spreadsheet. However, it was all worth it in the end when we got our spreadsheet to work.

    <td>I will try to try and figure things out for myself instead of just asking friends all of the time.

However I did get a very good outcome of a spreadsheet where you can make an order form.
You can order whatever you want below and you will be able to see how much it will cost.
