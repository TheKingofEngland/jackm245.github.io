    <td>We spent this lesson trying to learn the concagulate function. This needed lots of perseverance and collaboration with my peers. this is because it was very hard. The concatenate function is used to join two words together. We used the concatenate function in our drop down box where a customer could choose the type of animal that they would like to order. We used this function to join up the word code with the actual name of the word.This therefore makes the order form easier to use for the customer. This is important because, if something is hard, then people may stop using our brand and go to another company, instead of ours. This therefore makes the company more money. This is, if we were an actual business. I also added things like discounts, delivery and V.A.T to my order form, this makes it more sophisticated, but also allows for more options when it comes to the pricing. Things like descriptions are also really helpful aswell, this is because, it gives the customer a clear idea of what they are actually getting. This is really helpful for me to learn because, I will have to make order forms and spreadsheets like this when I am older, so doing it now in year 9 is really helpfull. Working with spreadsheets is also really helpful because it allows us to identify how things work, this can also be helpful when we are coding. It gives us a proper understanding of what happens with functions and pieces of code like that.

    <td>I will try to try and figure things out for myself instead of just asking friends all of the time.

However I did get a very good outcome of a spreadsheet where you can make an order form.
You can order whatever you want below and you will be able to see how much it will cost.

You will also be able to see how much V.A.T and delivery you are charged for.
