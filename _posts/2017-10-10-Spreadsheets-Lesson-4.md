    <td>Today was a cover lesson. This means that our fantastic teacher was away and that we have a supply teacher instead. However we did have set work to do. This lesson, we had to create three new sheets. This was hard at first because I could not remember how to do this. However, when I collaborated with the person next to me, it became easy. We also had to name these sheets which I easily remembered from last time how to do. We had to make three new sheets, cost, sales and profit and loss. We were mainly working on solely the cost sheet today. We had to think of all of the costs that we would need and then find out how much it actually costs. Some of the costs we had where, The van for delivery, petrol for the van, how much each animal costs, the food for that animal, the water that it needs, a habitat or home for it to stay in, a driver, some staff and things like electricity and broadband. It was hard to find out how much these things cost for two reasons: 1. That the rice for each item varies so dramatically and 2. That there isn't a website telling you how much a polar bear costs, let alone how much a habitat for it is worth. Therefore, I needed lots of perseverance because, I new that i would get to my goal in the end.

Here is what my sheet looks like so far:

    <td>I will try to try and figure things out for myself instead of just asking friends all of the time.

However I did get a very good outcome of a spreadsheet where you can make an order form.
You can order whatever you want below and you will be able to see how much it will cost.

You will also be able to see how much V.A.T and delivery you are charged for.
