Todays lesson didn't start very well. Almost every computer had major sign in issues. This was because some people had moved places so the computer that they were now using didn't recognise their email. This all ended in confusion and we had to get members of IT support to sort it out. However, we all persevered and got it under control again. 

After all of this pandemonium, we started to talk about supercomputers. I can't remember how the conversation even started, but it was a good conversation nonetheless. The world's fastest computer , the Sunway TaihuLight, holds a world record with a rating of 93 PFLOPS or 93 quadrillion floating point operations per second (or 93 million billion). This triples the old world record. This computer contains 10 million cores comprising of 41,000 nodes. The system has memory of 1.3PB, however, this is only 32GB per core, which is not very much.

However, if this supercomputer got in the wrong hands, it could do serious damage. It could brute hack an average password in seconds. Our teacher's Password is for his bank account is 36 digits long. This would take a normal computer 688 Nonillion years according to howsecureismypassword.net. However, this would only take this supercomputer minutes.

After we had finished talking about supercomputers, we started talking about our spreadsheets.We needed to complete a profit and loss sheet which says if I am losing or gaining money. I even made the cell change green if I am making money and red if I am losing money.

Here is my spreadsheet:</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited today because of disastrous logging in issues.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I personally Think that I am a "Very Good" student on the criteria that our teacher gave us. However, to push myself that bit harder and become an “Excellent Student” I will need to contribute and put my hand up in class. This is a target that I am trying to work on in all subjects, not just computer science.</td>
