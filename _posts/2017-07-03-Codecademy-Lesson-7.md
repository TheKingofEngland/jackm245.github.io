    <td>I learnt by using previous knowledge of the code. Today, I felt for the first time that I knew the language well enough to be confident and just write the code and build on my own knowledge rather than learning it completely new.

This helped me learn because it meant I could work through the exercises much quicker and so I learnt more in the lesson.

I used lots of perseverance today during the lesson. I needed this skill a lot . this is because, I am getting further through the syllabus and it is a lot harder than at the beginning of the term. I am having to ask my friends more and thing a lot harder this means that I am thinking more logically and this is helping me learn more and that's what school is about, therefore these last few IT lessons have really been helping me learn and also have helped me like IT more. 

I have been collaborating with my friends a lot because It is hard, this makes it more enjoyable and helps me get through the syllabus faster.

This lesson, I have learnt a lot about lists and dictionaries, how to easily edit them and delete them.

    <td> I need to work on concentrating on my own work and not helping other people as much. That means I will be able to get through even more work and maybe finish the course. Hove, this does not mean that I shouldn't work WITH my friends.</td>

    <td>Next time I will try to encourage others to work out their problems by themselves. This will help them learn more, and , in the long run, benefit them more than just helping them. I will also try to be more confident in myself and trust that the code which I put in will be right.</td>
